# **Welcome to the Whale Cup!**
## **The Whale Cup is a mahjong tournament to find the best tile slinger in an open format. All are welcome but only the strong and lucky will survive. This year we are sponsored by Riichi City, which I am super grateful for, they contributed to the prize pool and offered a ton of in game rewards. And didn't threaten to ban me for using a bot to run my tournament... Anyways!**
- ## 300 person cap on participants
- ## No Entry fee
- ## Only 64 can pass the qualifiers
- ## Two different time blocks until top 8
- ## Prize Pool is subject to **increase**
## The first weekend will act as a qualifier and will be omitted if we have under 64 contestants and increased to top 128 if we have over 200 active entries.  2 Additional games will occur on the 23rd if that occurs

## The second weekend will have two blocks, A and B. If you stated a preference on block you will be sorted into said preference depending on your score in the qualifier. No preference entries will be put in whatever is the gap.
